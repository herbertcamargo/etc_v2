# Coding Workflow Preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- DO NOT touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thoroug tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed to
- Always thinkk about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
